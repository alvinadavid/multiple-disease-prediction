Multiple Disease Prediction Application Using Python and Streamlit

# Problem Statement 
Many people struggle to check for multiple diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease separately. It takes time, effort, and multiple medical tests to know the chances of having these conditions. There is a need for one simple platform that can predict the risk of multiple diseases in one place using basic health information.

# Solution
This project is a web-based application made with Python and Streamlit that predicts the chances of having diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease based on user inputs such as glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI.
It uses machine learning models trained on real medical datasets and combines them into a single app with a clean and easy interface. The app includes a sidebar to switch between diseases, collects user details through simple forms, and displays prediction results instantly.
Models are saved using pickle files for quick and efficient loading, while feature engineering and encoding are applied to improve accuracy.
